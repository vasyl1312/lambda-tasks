## `Chapter 2`

<br/>
<h3><span style="color:yellow">8. <b>Instagram Giveaway </b></span></h3>

You have **20 files**, each containing 100,000 phrases ([**download**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cmfya22t3dr0ms5/2kk_words_400x400.zip?dl=0)) . Total - 2 million phrases. They were generated from two batches of 400 random words, so they are repeatedly repeated in all or some files. You need:

> 1Ô∏è‚É£ Determine how many **unique usernames** there are in all specified files (occurs at least once in any of the files).
>
> 2Ô∏è‚É£ Determine how many **usernames** occur simultaneously **in all 20 files**.
>
> 3Ô∏è‚É£ Find out how many **usernames** occur at the same time, **in at least 10 files**.

> **IMPORTANT: We measure the results of the execution of your program - how long does the program calculate (look for how to do this). If it takes you more than a few seconds to complete, then you are doing something wrong. Results with 5-12 or more minutes of execution are not accepted, alas, but this is a web.**

<aside>
üí° For practice, we suggest you first try your hand at a more "compact version" of the problem. In

([**this archive**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4llp3potsenghzg/200k_words_100x100.zip?dl=0))
there are still 20 files, but they already have 10 thousand (instead of 100 thousand as) phrases that were formed from two batches of random words 100 in each. Total 200,000 phrases.

**MANDATORY** indicate what answers you have when submitting this task. Need a cricket.

The answer is output in the console, after the launch of three separate functions. For example:

- `uniqueValues()` - _// ‚áí Unique phrases: 1234_
- `existInAllFiles()` - _// ‚áí Phrases found in all 20 files: 2222_
- `existInAtLeastTen()` - _// ‚áí Phrases found in at least ten files: 3333_

In total, we complete the task in **three** stages:

1Ô∏è‚É£ We take the first archive with 200,000 values and follow all three points above.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Repeat with an archive of 2 million values.

3Ô∏è‚É£ We think and offer a way to speed up the algorithm (we fight for the minimum execution time).

<h3><span style="color:yellow">9. <b>Vacation grouping</b></span></h3>

On the input you have JSON, in which you have developers. Each one has a unique id, name, and different holiday periods and other information. You literally have to "comb" this JSON into a different, more usable and versatile form.

  <img src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F96528f01-c8d5-49d7-a4be-262c97980c52%2FUntitled.png?id=33e03917-efba-489b-b1f2-f73b30d3112d&table=block&spaceId=2055905c-b0a9-4a70-840e-652fb3ddf0d4&width=990&userId=1eff93d4-281b-4cb7-9815-f73cb9b2abb3&cache=v2"/>

In the original JSON, when a user has **multiple periods** of holiday, this information is rendered \*\*as a separate object for the user name repeating.

**But we don't want it that way - we're drowning in optimization and convenience. Therefore:**

Write an algorithm that will **from the original JSON** make a neater and prettier one, in which:

1. There will be no "superfluous" fields like Status, usedDays, \_id of request.
2. Holiday periods will be output as an array in a nice and clear form.
3. The user himself will appear once in JSON regardless of number of holidays taken.

Here's an option that would be ideal for you to get:

<h3><span style="color:yellow">10. <b>JSON Sorting</b></span></h3>

So, you have a list of **20 endpoints**.

Each of them returns a response in a different format and with different key/value pairs. But they all have one thing in common - absolutely all GET-requests are returned by JSON which has the key ¬πisDone‚Ñ¢ with the boolean value. Queries are divided into four types in which the key/value you are seeking is at different levels of nesting.

Your task:

- Write an app that will poll all the above-mentioned endpoints. Consider a scenario in which a request will be sent several times (up to three is enough) if the previous request fails. If there is no response, remove the result from the issue, but print the error in the console.

- In all the endpoints you get, you need to find the key ÀêisDone‚Ñ¢ and find out if it has the value: √™ True‚Ñ¢ or ¬øFalse Àê.

The result of the successful launch of your application will be the response format:

<h3><span style="color:yellow">11. <b>Geopositioning by IP</b></span></h3>

So, you have at your disposal a CSV table [**table\***](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wo0dexr0p3q4fgb/IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB1.CSV?dl=0))., in which you will find a long list of rows with IP and 2-IP bands respectively.

Yours task is to write a web application on Express, highlighting the end point by which a server-hosted algorithm will be able to determine where the user came from and return the IP address value and the country from which the request was made.

- **The application should be able:**
  - _Identify the user‚Äôs IP phone by transition_
  - _Determine user location by IP phone using CSV base_
  - _return to the user the range of addresses (in the ¬´human¬ª clear form) and the country on table_

> üôè **Note,** NPM force, we acknowledge this, but you need to define the location WITHOUT additional modules, using the CSV file attached above.

Your project can be divided into several modules (why? - I wait for you in the box if you are stuck at the stage of understanding the task). Take your time, no rush. Your algorithm can work extremely slowly in the first stages, think about how it can be accelerated (little hello from the problem [**Insta Giveaway\***](https://github.com/vasyl1312/lambda-tasks/tree/main/main-chapter/8.instagramGiveaway)).

### **How do we check:**

Of course I will. But first the performance test: you run Ngrok on your side (**[link](https://ngrok.com/)** to familiarize this console utility), we knock on the endpoint code and want to see everything described above as a JSON-response.

### üëÜ **How to check yourself?**

We have prepared for you a list of IP addresses that are allocated to specific countries. If you have done everything correctly, your script should successfully return the response (or to start the output in the console), pointing to the correct country when sending the ID to the Body request:

> Chile - 45.232.208.143
> Armenia - 185.182.120.34
> Mexico - 45.177.176.23
> Turkey - 5.44.80.51
> Norway - 91.149.48.22
> Spain - 83.229.33.3
> Cyprus - 203.24.108.65
> UK - 23.43.23.15
> Ireland - 89.28.176.5
> Romania - 77.83.248.211

To check, you can also install Ngrok and play with Proxy by knocking on an open Ngrok address.
